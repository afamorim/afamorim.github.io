Some examples about real world problemns when we want to know 

### Command
I had the chance to use this pattern a few days ago and let's explain the case and the build solution.
A client of mine ask to me to build a functionality where He would me possible to register schedules builds.
So let's explain the solution.

I will take the focus on the solution of the "schedule build".
To this solution I have build some objects like you can see above
--image off the modal objects

Let's explain each one of this objects
> ScheduleVO
> 
> The object that will be used to persist the schedule that will be executed outside off the commercial time.
> It's the object where the user will select the "command" that have to be executed

> StatusSchedule
> 
> To check if schedule have been executed, not executed or executed with error.

> TypeSchedule
> 
> Will be used to make possible the selection of different builds that have to b executed
